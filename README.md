# Career Day Visual Simulation

This project provides a full-stack prototype for a "career day visual simulation" web application. Users can select a career persona, and the backend generates a timeline of events for that persona. Each event in the timeline will eventually include an image or short video generated by AI.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + JavaScript (for now, can be extended to TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Python
- **Media Generation (Planned):** Vertex AI Generative Media with fallback to Hugging Face diffusers
- **Data Storage (Planned):** Firestore (sessions/persona info)
- **Media Storage (Planned):** Cloud Storage

## Project Structure

- `my-frontend/`: React application for the user interface.
- `my-backend/`: FastAPI application that serves the API endpoints.
  - `my-backend/personas.json`: Sample persona data.
  - `my-backend/main.py`: FastAPI application with the `/simulate` endpoint.
  - `my-backend/requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the backend.

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or yarn) for the frontend.
- Python 3.8+ and pip for the backend.
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository).

### Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `my-backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-backend
    ```
2.  Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  Install the Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Run the FastAPI application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `my-frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd my-frontend
    ```
2.  Install the Node.js dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or yarn install
    ```
3.  Start the React development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## GCP Setup (Planned for full integration)

This section outlines the planned steps for setting up Google Cloud Platform services. **These steps are for future integration and are not yet implemented in the current prototype.**

### 1. Enable Google Cloud APIs

Enable the following APIs in your GCP project:

-   **Vertex AI API**
-   **Cloud Storage API**
-   **Firestore API**

### 2. Configure Authentication

For local development and Cloud Run deployment, you'll typically use Service Account authentication.

-   Create a Service Account in your GCP project with the necessary roles (e.g., `Vertex AI User`, `Storage Object Admin`, `Cloud Datastore User`).
-   Download the Service Account key as a JSON file.
-   Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path of your Service Account key file.

    ```bash
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    # $env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\keyfile.json"
    # On macOS/Linux:
    # export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"
    ```

### 3. Cloud Storage for Media

-   Create a Cloud Storage bucket for storing generated images and videos.
-   Ensure the Service Account has permissions to upload and retrieve objects from this bucket.

### 4. Firestore for Session/Persona Data

-   Create a Firestore database in Native mode.
-   Ensure the Service Account has permissions to read and write data to Firestore.

### 5. Vertex AI Generative Media

-   The backend will integrate with Vertex AI to generate images/videos based on `visual_prompt`s.
-   Specific Vertex AI model details (e.g., model ID, endpoint) will be configured in the backend.

## Docker and Cloud Run Deployment (Planned)

This section outlines the planned steps for containerizing and deploying the application to Google Cloud Run. **These steps are for future integration and are not yet implemented in the current prototype.**

### Dockerfile

A `Dockerfile` will be created in the `my-backend` directory to containerize the FastAPI application.

### Cloud Run Deployment

1.  Build the Docker image:
    ```bash
    gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/career-simulation-backend
    ```
2.  Deploy to Cloud Run:
    ```bash
    gcloud run deploy career-simulation-backend \
      --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/career-simulation-backend \
      --platform managed \
      --region [YOUR-GCP-REGION] \
      --allow-unauthenticated # Or configure authentication as needed
    ```

Replace `[PROJECT-ID]` with your Google Cloud Project ID and `[YOUR-GCP-REGION]` with your desired GCP region.
